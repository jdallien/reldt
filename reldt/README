1. Introduction
---------------

RelDT is a relational dual tableaux automated theorem prover written in XSB. 

RelDT is under development! If you find a theorem that does not produce a 
correct proof, please contact us. Visit our website for up to date contact 
information. Thank you.

----------------
2. Getting RelDT
----------------

RelDT can be downloaded from the RelDT website: http://logic.stfx.ca/reldt.html

XSB is required to use RelDT. The XSB installation files and instructions 
can be found on the XSB website: http://xsb.sourceforge.net/

-----------------
3. Starting RelDT
-----------------

After downloading the zip file containing the theorem prover files, 
extract the files into the desired location. There are four files:
	reldt.P   	XSB code for the RelDT Theorem prover
	reldtexamp.P	XSB code for some RelDT examples
	README	        This file.
	COPYING		Text of GNU General Public License (GPL)

Start XSB, then consult the RelDT source file, and the examples if desired: 

Type xsb to start XSB. The complete path may need to be used if the xsb 
executable is not in your PATH. Type [reldt]. to load the RelDT source 
file. A short message displaying the version of RelDT and the website will 
be displayed. Type [reldtexamp]. to load the RelDT examples.

---------------------
4. Testing a formula
---------------------

This section explains how to test your own formulas with the theorem 
prover. The included example file, reldtexamp.P is useful for seeing how 
this is done.

When testing a formula, it first must be translated into the required 
syntax for the theorem prover. Due to the restrictive nature of text based 
input, symbols have been replaced with short keywords. See the table below. 
Prolog terms beginning with a captial letter are used as Prolog variables, 
so for input to the theorem prover, all relation and variable names are 
entered in lower case to avoid conflicts. 

Relations are entered in the following manner: Rxy becomes rel(r, x, y).

Operation or 
Constant         RelDT Keyword
-------------------------------
 union              uni
 intersection       inter
 converse           conv
 composition        comp
 complement         -
 1     		    one
 1' 		    onep
 0 		    zero
   
The converse keyword is placed before the relation, like complement. 
Examples: conv r and - r


The theorem prover is started using the reldt/1 predicate with the formula 
to test as the parameter.

Example: reldt(rel(one inter one, x, y)).

------------------------
5. Theorem prover output
------------------------

The tableau is contained in a Prolog list, contained in square brackets. 
Each branch of the tableau is a list inside the main tableau list. After a 
rule is applied, the theorem prover displays the new contents of the tableau 
list. If a branch is found to be closed, it is removed from the tableau 
list. Because the lists are always displayed at the left side of the screen, 
branches may not correspond to the branch displayed directly above it, if a 
branch was removed.

If all the branches are found to close, the theorem prover will output the 
message: "Relational theorem". If a point is reached where no rules can be 
applied but any open branch remains, the theorem prover will output the 
message: "Not a relational theorem".

----------------
6. RelDT Options
----------------

RelDT has two options which can be enabled or disabled depending on the 
desired behaviour: 

Reflexivity of R: A reflexive rule for the relation r in input formulas can 
be enabled or disabled using this option. 
Symmetry of R: symmetry rule for the relation r in input formulas can be 
enabled or disabled using this option.

To change these options, edit the RelDT source file and find the 
ReflexivityOfR and SymmetryOfR options near the top. Setting an option to 
`fail` disables it, setting it to 'true' enables it. Both options are 
disabled by default.

------------------
7. Extending RelDT
------------------

RelDT can be extended with new rules or axiomatic sequences. In general, 
the steps for adding a new rule are:

Write a predicate to recognize what type of formula to which the rule 
applies. This is like the unary, conjunctive and disjunctive predicates 
RelDT contains. If the new rule fits an existing type then another one of 
these predicates can be added to the existing ones. If a new type of rule 
is needed, a new predicate with a new name should be added to recognize it. 

The format of the recognizing predicates are:
	type(formula pattern) :- extra conditions. 

Use the anonymous variable _ to indicate parts of the formula where relations 
with unknown names will be located in the formula. The theorem prover tries 
to match each formula it is testing with the recognizing predicates. The 
extra conditions are optional. In the standard RelDT, it is only used to 
detect whether the SymmetryOfR rule has been enabled. 

If an existing rule type is used, the existing singlestep or singlestepextra 
predicates will recognize and apply the rule appropriately. If a new rule 
type is added, a new singlestep or singlestepextra predicate will need to be 
added which places the components of the formula in the appropriate spots in 
the tableau list. Singlestep predicates require only the formula and tableau 
data to apply the rule. singlestepexta predicates require additional 
information to be passed in, such as variable tracking lists.

The singlestep and singlestepextra predicates use the components predicates 
to retrieve what new formulas will be added to the tableau as a result of the 
rule. Components predicates take in the formula that appears on the top of 
the rule as a parameter and return the one or more formulas that appear 
below the line of the rule. A component predicate will need to be added for 
each new rule being added.

To add new axiomatic sequences, additional closed predicates are used. A 
closed predicate takes in a branch of the tableau as a parameter and tests 
to see if it contains an axiomatic sequence. The branch is a Prolog list, so 
the member/2 predicate can be used to find the sequence anywhere in the 
branch, if that is how it is to be used. For example, in standard RelDT, the 
appearance of rel(one, _, _) anywhere in a branch is enough to close that 
branch. This axiomatic sequence is the first closed predicate in RelDT.
